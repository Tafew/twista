# Twista
Twista is a Twitter streaming and analysis command line tool suite implemented in Python 3.6. It provides the following core features:

- to __crawl__ HTML pages for Twitter accounts,
- to __collect__ Tweets (statuses, replies, retweets, replies) for a specified set of screennames,
- and to __transform__ collected chunks of Tweets into a [NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io/) graph for follow up analysis of observed Twitter interactions.

How to use Twista for recording and analysis of Twitter stream can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/nkratzke/twista/wiki).
